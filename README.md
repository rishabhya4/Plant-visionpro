Plant Vision Pro is an AI-powered plant disease detection system that uses machine learning to identify and diagnose plant health issues. This application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading plant images and receiving detailed analysis of potential diseases and treatment recommendations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Advanced machine learning algorithms for accurate plant disease identification
- **Image Upload**: Easy drag-and-drop interface for uploading plant images
- **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive reports with disease identification and treatment suggestions
- **History Tracking**: Save and review previous detection results
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Backend**: Supabase for database and authentication
- **AI Integration**: Custom machine learning models for plant disease detection
